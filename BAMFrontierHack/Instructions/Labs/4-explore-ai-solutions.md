## Step 4: Explore AI Solutions

With your pain points mapped, explore possible solutions.  Use Copilot to surface ideas, review them and decide on the best option to carry forward.

You’ll complete the following tasks:

- **Use Researcher** to generate solution ideas  
- **Review the output** and your own brainstorming  
- **Select the most promising solution(s)**

> Complete all tasks in this step before moving forward; sample prompts are just a starting point—adapt or create your own as needed.

### Task 1: Use Researcher to Gather Ideas

Run a query in **Researcher**.  While it runs (it may take several minutes), brainstorm possible solution approaches—what tools, automations or AI capabilities might help?  Later, compare these ideas with the Researcher output.

**Tip:** Idea Coach can help you brainstorm while you wait.

**Steps (for Researcher)**

- Open a new browser tab and navigate to `m365.cloud.microsoft/chat`.  
- In the M365 Copilot menu, expand **Agents** and select **Researcher**.  

**Sample Prompt**

```text
Propose AI-powered solutions to directly address this problem: [Inset problem statement]

1. Start with three bullet points summarizing the most relevant challenges or pain points that make this problem worth solving.  
2. Suggest up to three specific AI solutions. For each, include:  
   - Solution Name (be specific, e.g., “Copilot Studio Agent that auto-flags duplicate course files”)  
   - How it would work to solve this problem in practice  
   - Key Benefits for the team or organization  
3. Conclude with one clear recommendation: which single solution is most promising, and why it stands out over the others.  
```

> **Note:** Researcher may ask for additional context to refine its output before completing a response.  Keep an eye out and provide input if prompted.

### Task 2: Review & Decide

Review the three summary bullets and the solution from Researcher along with any ideas you brainstormed.  React to its recommendation—do you agree, or would you choose differently?  Capture two or three final approach options, marking the one you’ll carry forward.

## Your Output

**Section:** *Approach Options*

In your template, fill in the **Approach Options** section.  Summarize the solutions you reviewed, including the one you selected to carry forward.
