Welcome to the **BAM Frontier Hack**! This lab is about exploring how AI can help you tackle real challenges at work.

You’ll define a problem, brainstorm solutions and choose the best option—with the help of Copilot.  The goal is to accelerate alignment on the Frontier Firm concept and generate problem statements and solution ideas that could inform future agent development; the focus is on framing challenges, ideating and evaluating with AI—not delivering a finished agent.

## Event Flow

- **Define a challenge**  
- **Break down the problem**  
- **Explore AI solutions**  
- **Make the case**

## What to know

- **Prompts:** You’ll see suggested prompts throughout—use them for inspiration or try your own.  
- **Balance:** Use both Copilot and your own reflection throughout—neither replaces the other.
