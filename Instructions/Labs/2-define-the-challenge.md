## Step 2: Define the Challenge

Identify and decide on one challenge to focus on for the rest of this lab.  It could be something simple, like scheduling meetings, or something complex—processes tied to multiple systems, sensitive data or compliance requirements.  The goal is to spark thought about what’s working, what’s not and where AI might play a role.

You’ll complete the following tasks:

- **Explore challenges or opportunities** in your work environment  
- **Prioritize them** against business priorities  
- **Select one challenge** to carry forward as your problem statement  

> **Note:** Complete all tasks in this step before moving forward.  Sample prompts are just a starting point—adapt or create your own and refine until Copilot delivers the results you need.  
> **Reminder:** Balance your own reflection with Copilot insights—neither replaces the other.  Use Copilot to surface ideas, then reflect to decide what resonates most.

### Task 1: Explore Challenges or Opportunities

Use **Copilot Chat** to identify common challenges in your day‑to‑day work.

**Steps**

- Open a new browser tab and navigate to `m365.cloud.microsoft/chat`.  
- Ensure the **Work mode** tab is selected in Copilot Chat.  

**Sample Prompt**

```text
I’m investigating common day-to-day issues I face at work, such as processes, collaboration, or time management. Look at recent conversations from my Teams chats and emails related to [your role focus, i.e., content development, technical training, program management]. Summarize the key issues or pain points mentioned in the last 6 months and limit the output to the top 3 most relevant issues only. Show the results in a table with: 

- Title: Short label for the issue  
- Problem Statement: Write each as a clear and concise statement of the challenge  
- Frequency: How often it comes up (e.g., number of mentions) 
```

> Replace the text within brackets with your specific role focus (e.g., program management).  
> **Tip:** You can ask Copilot to output the full table directly into a Word document for easier sharing. For extra help writing or refining prompts, try Prompt Coach.

### Task 2: Prioritize Against Business

Review the problem statements Copilot surfaced in Task 1, then run them back through Copilot to align with organizational priorities.

**Sample Prompt**

```text
Which of these issues is most worth exploring further, when aligned to organizational priorities set by /[name of org leader or manager]?  
```

> Use the `/` reference feature in Copilot Chat to tag the leader or manager by name.

### Task 3: Select Your Problem Statement

Choose one challenge or opportunity to carry forward.  Capture it clearly and simply—this will be your problem statement for the rest of the lab.

> **Tip:** If you’d like, you can use Copilot to refine the wording of your chosen statement for clarity or impact.

## Your Output

**Section:** *Problem or opportunity statement*

In your template, fill in the **Problem or opportunity statement** section.  Summarize the single challenge or opportunity you identified as a clear, concise statement.
