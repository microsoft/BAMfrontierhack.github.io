## Step 5: Make the Case

Select the solution you believe is the best fit and justify your choice.  Explain clearly why you chose it, why others weren’t selected, and ensure it’s the right level of complexity.

You’ll complete the following tasks:

- **Evaluate your shortlisted solutions** with Copilot  
- **Select one solution** to carry forward  
- **Justify** why it’s the best fit and why others were not chosen  

> Complete all tasks in this step before finishing; sample prompts are just a starting point—adapt or create your own as needed.

### Task 1: Evaluate with Copilot

Run your shortlisted solutions through Copilot to test the reasoning.  Ask it to:

- Justify why a given solution fits your problem  
- Suggest alternatives you may not have considered  
- Highlight risks, limitations or gaps  

**Sample Prompt**

```text
We are considering these AI solutions: [list options]. Which is the best fit for addressing [insert problem statement], and why? Suggest alternatives we may not have considered, and explain risks or limitations of each choice.  
```

### Task 2: Select & Justify

Select one solution to carry forward.  For your chosen option, capture:

- Why this solution is the best fit  
- Why other options were not selected  
- How this solution avoids unnecessary complexity  

## Your Output

**Section:** *Chosen AI/Microsoft Solution & Why*

In your template, fill in the **Chosen AI/Microsoft Solution & Why** section.  Summarize the AI/Microsoft solution you selected, explain why it’s the best fit, and note why other options were not chosen.
