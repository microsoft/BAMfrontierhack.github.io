## Step 3: Break Down the Problem

Now that you’ve defined a problem statement, dig deeper.  Map out the pain points, inefficiencies and root causes that make this problem worth solving.

You’ll complete the following tasks:

- **Map pain points and inefficiencies**  
- **Use Copilot** to expand on causes, impacts and related discussions  

> Complete all tasks in this step before moving forward; sample prompts are just a starting point—adapt or create your own as needed.

### Task 1: Map Pain Points

Document where the current process breaks down.  Focus on:

- Manual tasks  
- Bottlenecks  
- Data gaps  
- Sources of frustration  

If the problem feels broad, consider smaller parts—what contributes most and what might be a quick win?  *(Optional: consider impact metrics like lost time, extra cost or reduced quality to help Copilot better frame the problem.)*

### Task 2: Explore with Copilot

After listing pain points, use **Copilot Chat** to expand your understanding.  Ask:

- What are likely root causes?  
- What impacts does this issue have on people, workflows or outcomes?  
- Have related suggestions surfaced in the past six months?  

**Sample Prompt**

```text
Explore the issue of [Insert Problem Statement Here]. Look for factors that contribute to this problem, its impact on people or workflows, and any related discussions or suggestions raised in the past six months. Summarize your findings in a simple table with three columns: Insight Type (Cause, Impact, or Suggestion), Description, and Source.  
```

> **Tip:** You can ask Copilot to output the full table directly into a Word document for easier sharing and formatting.

## Your Output

**Section:** *Pain Points & Inefficiencies*

In your template, fill in the **Pain Points & Inefficiencies** section.  Summarize the main breakdowns you identified, along with any root causes, impacts or suggestions surfaced with Copilot.
